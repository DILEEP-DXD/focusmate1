# FocusMate - Your Personal Study Companion

Hey there! üëã Welcome to FocusMate, a web app I built to make studying smarter and a whole lot less stressful. It's packed with tools designed to help you focus, learn better, and actually enjoy your study breaks.

## What's Inside? ‚ú®

Here's a peek at what FocusMate offers:

### üìö Study Tools - Master Your Material

*   **Flashcards:** Beyond just flipping cards, you can now create your *own* topics and flashcards. Perfect for those niche subjects or personal notes!
*   **Adaptive Quiz:** Test your knowledge with quizzes that actually adapt! They pull questions from your flashcards, get tougher as you improve, track your progress, and give you instant feedback on how you're doing.

### ‚è∞ Break Zone - Recharge and Realign

*   **Your Timer, Your Rules:** Set your own break time, not just fixed options. Get a friendly nudge (or alert!) when it's time to get back.
*   **Activities for Every Mood:** Stuck on what to do for a break? Choose from guided activities like Deep Breathing, Quick Stretches, Mindful Meditation, Desk Yoga, or even a Power Nap. Filter them by how you want to feel ‚Äì quick, relaxing, or energizing.
*   **Know Your Vibe:** The Mood Tracker lets you log how you're feeling using emojis, add notes, set intensity, and even tag what you were doing. Over time, you can see patterns and how different breaks impact your mood.

*   **Theme Switcher:** Easily flip between dark and light themes right from the Navbar ‚Äì your eyes will thank you!
*   **Navbar:** It's been enhanced for better navigation, includes a mobile menu (visible on desktop too, just for easy access!), integrates the theme switcher, and has clear Login/Get Started buttons.
*   **Back to Top:** A subtle button appears as you scroll down to quickly take you back to the top without fuss.
